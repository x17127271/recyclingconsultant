                        We investigate particular sets of circumstances existing within a specific environment i.e. a
                        bottling factory. It is our task to find out how at how they can be improved in terms of energy
                        efficiency, waste and water resource management. We then identify what can be done to conserve
                        resources, cut waste and pollution and increase efficiency. Solutions can then be put in place
                        by making use of appropriate technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and staff
                        training.
